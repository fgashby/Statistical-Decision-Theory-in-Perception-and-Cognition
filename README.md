This repository includes the three Matlab programs listed in Appendix B of the following book:

Ashby, F. G. (2026). Statistical decision theory in perception and cognition: Signal detection
and general recognition theories. MIT Press.

Please see the book for detailed descriptions, but briefly:

Generate_Stimuli.m is Matlab code that creates stimuli in RB and II tasks that are exactly matched
on most category-separation statistics.

OneD_fit.m is Matlab code that fits a decision-bound model that assumes a one-dimensional explicit
rule to categorization data

GLC_fit.m is Matlab code that fits the general linear classifier to categorization data

The repository also includes the file Guessing_fit.m, which fits a model that assumes the
participant guesses response A on each trial with some unknown probability p.
